This is my week 04 its been kind of very hectic and very confusing working on Chapter02. The many times in this chapter I felt lost and not knowing what I was doing nor why, but I have gotten help from a couple of my classmates that can explain to me stuff much more simple so I could understand this. I loved the activity you assigned each one of us to work on that was pretty cool and creative working with the Scrum Board.
