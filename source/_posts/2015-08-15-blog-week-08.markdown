This is my blog from week08 it's been a pretty crazy week driving myself insane trying to meet all the deadlines as much as possible with very little sleep to try and keep up. After my incident on Wednesday with four shots of expresso never again will I do that, it had me shaking, nausious and my blood pressure went sky high. I learned my lesson with that it made me feel super sick. This week I've been multitasking at everything if I got stuck on something, I just jumped to another while I think about. I know for a fact that I can be very stuburn in getting an answer unless I get give up and then I ask for help.
