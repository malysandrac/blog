My blog week 09 I loved class this week because I felt that I had some actual time to work on stuff that I still need to finish that I haven't had a chance to even get to without new stuff being thrown at me. I am
so thankful for alot of classmates that sit next to me we work great together and figure things out and are very helpful when one is struggling.
I was very scared about doing the Mock Interviews but now that its over and done now I feel a big relief.
