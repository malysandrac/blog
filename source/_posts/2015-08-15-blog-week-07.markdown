My blog post for week 07 its has been a crazy week I'm at the point of giving up on this I feel like a total failer in here. No matter how much effort or determination I put in this class I it's not getting me no where. The more I see my report card, the more deppressing it gets. I feel so desapointed in seeing my report card its not even funny no more. I am trying my best to meet all these deadlines but it never seems enough and I dont like feeling this way it stressing me alot. Me and Code School are at the point of breaking up and taking a break it keeps clitching and acting up when I am puting the correct answer.
